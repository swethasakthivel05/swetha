        The idea behind World Laughter Day is to spread the message that
        laughter is a powerful tool for improving physical and mental health,
        reducing stress, and enhancing social connections. Laughter has been
        shown to boost the immune system, increase blood flow, and release
        endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. The day is celebrated
        through various events and activities such as laughter yoga sessions,
        comedy shows, and community gatherings where people come together to
        laugh and spread joy. The aim is to create a positive and uplifting
        atmosphere that promotes laughter, happiness, and well-being.
